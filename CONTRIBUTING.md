# Pull Request Guidelines

Pull requests, issues and comments welcome. For pull requests:

* Add tests for new features and bug fixes
* Follow the existing style
* Separate unrelated changes into multiple pull requests

See the [existing issues](https://github.com/HatsuneMiku3939/slashes/issues)
for things to start contributing.

For bigger changes, make sure you start a discussion first by creating
an issue and explaining the intended change.
